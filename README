EQ10Q LV2 Plugin
-----------------

EQ10Q is an audio plugin over the LV2 standard (http://lv2plug.in) implementing
a powerfull and flexible parametric equalizer.
Eq10q equalizer plugin includes a parametric equalization with diferent filter types 
like peaking, HPF, LPF, Shelving and Notch
with IIR algorithms and a nice GUI displaying the equalization curve.

At the moment we have implemented second order biquadratic filters (Peaking, Low Shelving,
High Shelving and Notch), and configurable order (1, 2, 3, 4) HPF and LPF filters.
All with IIR algorithms. And a GUI writed with Gtkmm (http://www.gtkmm.org) to control 
all the parameters and display the curve using plotmm (http://plotmm.sourceforge.net).
The plugin is over LV2 standard and writed in C for the audio DSP and C++ for the GUI.

EQ10Q is hosted at http://eq10q.sourceforge.net/
Main developer: Pere Ràfols Soler (sapista2@gmail.com)

Installation
------------
EQ10Q plugin will be installed into /usr/local/lib/lv2 as default.

Before install EQ10Q you must resolve all required libraries:
  - G++ compiler
  - cmake
  - pkg-config
  - LV2 Headers
  - Gtkmm >= 2.4
  - FFTW3

To install EQ10Q in your system open a terminal, go to EQ10Q top level folder and just type:
 
  cmake ./

If cmake configures successfully the build enviorment then type:

  make

If make finish successfully type the following as root

  make install

To run EQ10Q you need a LV2 host. I recomend Ardour (<= 2.8.3) http://ardour.org

Uninstallation
--------------
Remove the EQ10Q directory, as default /usr/local/lib/lv2/sapistaEQv2.lv2
